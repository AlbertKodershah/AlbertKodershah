### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
- ğŸŒ± Studying to become a Data Engineer, finishing May 2025. Iâ€™m currently learning about all things data and Business Intelligence.
- ğŸ”­ My current and last course is "Data Extraction, Migration, and Transformation (ETL/ELT)" with Gabriel Bergqvist.
- ğŸ’¬ I'm a huge wiz but also steadily evolving in DAX, Power BI and SQL, so feel free to ask me about anything within those spheres.
