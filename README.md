### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
- ğŸŒ± Studying to become a Data Engineer, finishing May 2025. Iâ€™m currently learning about all things data and Business Intelligence.
- ğŸ”­ My current course is "Programming in Python" with Gabriel Bergqvist.
- ğŸ’¬ I'm a huge wiz in Power BI and SQL, namely SQL Server, so feel free to ask me about anything within those spheres.
